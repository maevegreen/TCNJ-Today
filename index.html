    <h2>Top News Stories</h2>
    <p>It’s not often you walk into a classroom to attend a presentation and find that it’s going to be given, in part, by a dog.

Bob the golden retriever recently accompanied his owner, psychology professor Jean Kirnan, for a talk on animal-assisted intervention: the use of animals to promote human wellness.

Bob,10, is Kirnan’s family pet and her professional partner. As a certified therapy dog, he goes on regular visits to West Belmar Elementary School, where children read to him in small groups as part of a dog-assisted literacy program called Tail Waggin’ Tutors. According to Kirnan, the program is effective in teaching students both reading and behavioral skills.</p>
